 <h1>Background Info</h1>
 <body>
  <p>Raton in Spanish means “small rat” or “mouse.” Furthermore, Raton originally had the name Willow Springs, moreover, Willow Springs depot was the site Raton was founded on for the Santa Fe Trail. The pass is deemed hazardous by many for its unforgiving terrain. The Sangre de Cristo Mountain was a key way for wagons to pass through and access the territory New Mexico. However, passing through was not easy feat, those who dared to pass through lost wagons, animals, and even their lives.</p>

<h1>Raton Pass used during Mexican-American War</h1>
<p>During the Mexican-American War the Raton Pass was used by General Stephan Watts Kearny. He chose to use this pass instead of the Cimarron Route because the rough and steep terrain of the pass allowed for better protection enemy forces and access to readily available water. The Raton Pass however did manage to ware down General Kearny’s men and their supplies. To General Kearny’s and his men’s surprise the Mexican forces were not there waiting once they came through the pass. General Kearny was able to march on towards Santa Fe and claim the territory for the United States.</p> 
<h1>Raton Pass Toll Road</h1>
<p>The Toll Road to maintain the Raton Pass was built by Richens Wootton. Wootton saw the chance to make money from building the road and charging a fee for those who used it. Furthermore, Wooton secured legislation from New Mexico and Colorado to do so. People who used the toll roads were American firefighters, Mexicans, stage coach companies, Indians, and military. The toll road price that was set was between $1.00 and $1.50 for passage through.</p>
<h1>Railway</h1>
<p>The Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway was interested in developing the Richens Wootton toll road into as railway. They offered him the sum of $50,000 to buy in 1878. However, Wootton rejected this offer and only wished for two things to make a deal. He asked that they give his wife a free pass and groceries for life. The railway happy obliged Wootton and made sure to take care of her until her passing.</p>
