# Pawnee Rock



In a hot summer in modern-day in Kansas there is a rock mound that sits but, in a city, surrounded with a mural dedicating itself to aside for preservice. Many who go by this mound don't just see does a piece of land making a blimp off in the distance or a mark in the landscape, but it does seem in a way scarred with the many things that surround the place. on the mural, it says Pawnee Rock. On this pillar, you see an image of a Buffalo that seems to be slaughtered by the neck down. Above that is the picture of a Native American woman holding a stick on the right hand. that dedication message from the Woman's Kansas Day Club around 1911. And a relative of the surrounding area of flatlands and Hills this Bluff only stands. Years of the industrial Railroad and mining. Much of it doesn't stand today. Still to its memory of the people of Kansas it is a beautiful landmark of great importance to their culture and origins of that state. That it is publicly remembered of the lost and forgotten history of that time.

## Pawnee Raid

The place to wear pointy rock is have been significant even before the immigration of Europeans to the continent. Through geographer surveys an oral telling through the tribes that lived in the area, it was used as a place for meetings of the many tribes, such as the Comanche, Kiowa, Arapaho, And the Cheyenne tribes. There was no specific information on what was discussed in the significance of the meaning of why these tribes met at this turn location other than it's a view of the plane surrounding it. Still, it was significant enough that diplomacy was made here. Along with that, many Battles through archaeological findings. As a possible conclusion to the location, it was also outpost or surveillance site for hunting for Buffalo/Bison. This is also the same for ambush is a fellow rival tribesmen and bandits. There was no natural order of who owned this specific land more like it was shared through the current people that are camping on that spot during that time. As the same for a predator watching from a tree, this is equivalent to a party finding who to attack or defend from next. Much of its running rocks are not there anymore due to settlers taking the rock from the Bluff, and train tracks. Still, if such a person wants is scouring the area through the many tiny pieces and broken gravel would see old bones broken and possibly see arrowheads. If you dug deeper you might even find a Skelton or 2. Through archeology it seems that this rock has been used even before the main tribes was there, even possible prehistoric tribes that have lost their names and meanings over the years have the users place for the same reasons as I said previously. But as to the main part of the soul prehistoric location, its historical significance is extremely underrated to its geographer culture and relevance and its geography cultural and negative American history. Even its name Pawnee rock was an assumption of the tribe who owned it. As said previously it was used by many other tribes and it seemed to be shared in away. It doesn't mean pacifically it always has been like that weird there could have been a time as a tribe pacifically protected that location and kept it from any other tribe in the around that area previously even earlier in the non-historical timeline of North America as much of that has historically been undiscovered. There could be more historical research into understanding this timeline to what we can find about the historical significance of this location even before the tribes that roamed the area but do to Native American laws of preserving their dead. Archaeologists cannot legally search burial grounds and do carbon dating of when these people have died and how they died.

## The Louisiana Purchase and those who passed Pawnee Rock

Much of the great change to the point was caused by the Louisiana Purchase. The direct transaction of the land from Ohio to the edge of the Mississippi river sold by the First French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte to 3rd American President Thomas Jefferson. Propaganda was sold by the government to the disenfranchise and the poor of an opportunity to make more of their current situation. Among those who did believe in this cause called it "Manifest Destiny." Certain Towns were created to allow this effort to continue and one of them was called Independence, Missouri. This was the starting point for the Santa Fe Trail. It started in there and ended in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The significance of the Pawnee rock to this trail is that it was the halfway point between the start and end of the trail.  A common tradition on the trail for those going past the rock monument is putting their name on the rock. James Burch, a soldier in 1848 quote saying "Pawnee Rock was carved with names to all the men who have passed it. It was so full there was no place for mine" Much of it is gone. Still, there is much evidence left of this. There is a famous picture of people standing on top of the rock taking a photo. As to the name of Pawnee Rock, legend says of the mountain man Kit Carson, the founder of the eventual Nevada Capital "Carson City". While on night watch he shot his mule thinking it was a Pawnee Indian. Much of the incident was for the reason of the name. but much of the Pawnee didn't own the rock nor most of them lived in Nebraska territory around that time. As for more first accounts for this monument on the Santa Fe Trail. Much information that I was able to find had a paywall to this location to which makes it very difficult to get more of a context of first accounts for people who were there around the 1800s expansion era. Much data that would take a researcher to collect as a job position would be less difficult as they would have a budget buying data off other organizations for their research projects over even those who are getting their thesis.  To this day much of the tribe does live in the city to where it was named. Much of the public memory of this location makes impacts on the people who went by there and the rumors that were made around the area.

## Present Day and its significance

Even know to our public knowledge of this place isn't known unless to those who live in Kanas or around that area, it is still very important that this is a landmark of the human memory that must be preserved for historical sake. This location was almost forgotten, still, much of the knowledge that has past and the memories that have been past down of the location did leave a mark to some people. The organization the Woman's Kanas Day Club bought the land to where the Pawnee rock was and put up a memorial of the significance to the Native Americans. Around this time the influences of President Theodore Roosevelt put forth a conversation policy of protecting forests and historical monuments. Many governors and organizations continued their work in preserving such historical and natural monuments. To the Pawnee Tribe, many of them travel to Pawnee Rock City every year for a Pow Wow celebrating their culture and history. Much as the national Pow Wow is in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Certain tribes celebrate there own Pow Wows at there own tribal sites.
