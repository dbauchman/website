# Down in the valley: La Junta de los Rios
## A site for sore eyes: La Junta
La Junta (“the junction”) in Mora County, New Mexico marks the crossing of two rivers- the Mora and the Sapello. Historian Francis Stanley writes that this area is where "the Sapello and Mora Rivers unite to exchange gossip brought in from the mountains” (Stanley, 1962, 3). Stanley’s metaphor rings true—the valley served as a good meeting point, as it is easily identifiable.
 Visitors to La Junta, especially those who had grown used to the dry, arid climate of the southwest, remarked on its serene beauty. La Junta featured healthy, rich soil, a green valley, and a plethora of wildlife-- including deer, wild ducks, quail, and antelope (Clark, 1969, 47). The Mora and Sapello rivers were decorated with large, healthy trees, including pine, junipers, wild plum, and oak (Clark, 1969, 47).  
“Every rise formed a plateau valley, fertile and lush with waving grey-green grasses. Grama and blue-joint grasses grey more than a foot in height” (Clark, 1969, 47).
In 1963, this area was deemed a National Historic Landmark, which begged the question: what’s the big deal about a river crossing, no matter how beautiful? La Junta the first sight of civilization for many weary travelers along Santa Fe Trail. The area, served as a campsite, trading area, and rest stop for many, including indigenous tribes.

## Here first – La Junta’s early occupiers
 Before the first traveler set foot on the over 800- mile stretch of the Santa Fe Tral (NPS, 2018), La Junta was used by several indigenous tribes including the Utes, the Comanches, the Kiowas, Navajos, Arapahoes, and the Jicarilla Apaches. These tribes hunted, traded, and camped on the land (Kosmider, 1983, 22) (Stanley, 1962, 3). The Ute and Jicarilla tribes were nomadic (Kosmider, 1983, 30).  
## The Scolly Land Grant
On March 27, 1843, James Giddings and several other men from Spain wrote a petition to the Mexican governor Manuel Armijo, asking for rights to ten leagues of La Junta and the valley surrounding it (Stanley. 1962, 5).  In the petition, Giddings, along with ten other men, outlined the land, noting its rich soil that would be used for planting crops, raising sheep for wool, constructing mills and creating a civilization with “a population composed of laborious and enterprising men” (Stanley, 1962, 5).  The process of obtaining this land proved difficult, however. Though Armijo had approved the petition, allowing them a year and a half to begin cultivating the land, the original petitioners did not gain ownership of the land until May 1846, under Mexican Governor Manuel Armijo (Kosmider, 1983, 24). Stanley writes that they were sent away by members of the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Stanley, 1962, 6). Many of the original petitioners shied away after this, leaving the grant to just a few men: John Scolly, William T. Smith, Alexander Barclay, and, later, Samuel Watrous.  
“An abode for men and animals” (Kosmider, 1983, 25): Barclay’s Fort
On June 11, 1846, Alexander Barclay, along with Joseph Doyle, laid the first adobe brick of Fort Barclay (Kosmider, 1983, 25). Consisting of over forty rooms, the fort was described as “an abode for men and animals...formidable” (Kosmider, 1983, 25) by U.S. Attorney for the Terrioty of New Mexico, W.W. H. Davis in November 1853 (NPS 2).  Davis, however, was not pleased with the interior of the fort, noting it was reminiscent of some “old state prison where the good and great of former times have languished away their lives” (NPS 2). Despite such a scathing remark, many travelers of the Santa Fe Trail stopped here to rest, acquire goods and supplies, and escape the elements and potential indigenous attacks (Kosmider, 1983, 26). Barclay later attempted to sell the fort to the U.S. Army, but they declined the offer. In 1856, William Kroening bought Fort Barclay and the land around it (NPS 3).  
“A New Englander with a thirst for adventure” (Clark, 1969, 39): Samuel Watrous 
Samuel Watrous was a New Englander who traveled to New Mexico in search of new opportunity.  He was person with “untiring energy...hard work, vigilance against Indians” (Stanley, 1962 7).  After settling in the La Junta valley, Watrous experienced hostility from the Ute, Kiowas, Jicarilla Apache, and Comanche tribes, who “vehemently disapproved of settlers encroaching upon their hunting grounds” (Kosmider, 1983, 3). Frustrated, Watrous spent two decades sending letters to politicians, newspapers, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (Kosmider, 1983, 3). By the close of the 19th century, the Indigenous peoples of the area were sent to live on reservations (Kosmider, 1983, vi). 
## From La Junta to Watrous: a town emerges

“No longer could an individual stand at his doorstep and watch thundering herds of buffalo...run silhouetted against the mountains, nor could one experience the euphoric sesation of treading a hidden path....now...telegraph poles marched off toward the flat horizon...the shrill of a locomotive whistle beckoned in the distance...” (Kosmider, 1983, 1). 
After Watrous obtained part of the Scolly land grant for La Junta in 1849 (Kosmider, 1983, 28), he spent no time constructing a twenty-room adobe home, complete with a storefront. Watrous hired Spanish and indigenous workers, including cooks, maids, hunters, and nurses to work in the Watrous home as well as the store (Clark, 1969, 48). The Watrous house would be deemed “the nucleus of the settlement of La Junta” (NPS Nomination Form, 3).  The Watrous store was successful, in part due to its proximity to the Santa Fe Trail (Clark, 1969, 51).  Eventually, the name of La Junta would be lost, and the area between the Mora and Sapello rivers would be known as Watrous. 
“When there was nothing else to do he would say,
‘Come now, we will plant more trees’.” (Clark, 1969, 49).
In addition to his entrepreneurship, Watrous was a passionate arborist.  He planted willows along irrigation ditches, transplanted many cottonwoods, and imported German prune and Richmond cherry trees from Missouri (Clark, 1969, 49-52). Visitors to the ares suggested it was “one of the finest orchards o the region” (Kosmider, 1983, 29). 
By drafting letters to the Bureau of Indian affairs, newspapers, and politicians with suggestions for solving the “Indian problem” (Kosmider, 1983, 3), planting trees and constructing a large building, and later the first fencing in the area (Clark, 1969, 53), La Junta was “no longer a wilderness” (Fischer, 1998, 8).  Watrous had altered the landscape of the area permanently: gone was untamed environment. Gone was the indigenous tribe's ability to reside in the area.  In its place, the land was cultivated, foundations and buildings were placed upon it (foundations, that in fact, still exist today), and indigenous tribes were forced onto reservations. The area was on its way to becoming a town.   

## Friend or foe? Samuel Watrous versus Indigenous tribes
After the Watrous house was constructed, Kosmider suggests that Samuel was on good terms with the indigenous tribes, allowing them to stay on his land, trading goods with them.  According to Kosmider, he also purchased indigenous captives, “taking the young Indian boys and girls to raise with his own family” (Kosmider, 1983, 29).Clark, too, writes that Watrous was on friendly terms with many indigenous peoples, noting that he “felt of wave of compassion”, Clark, 1969, 42) for them. Clark also writes that he spent time visiting with indigenous tribes and learning their spiritual and farming practices (Clark, 45). However, his active letter writing to the Bureau of Indian Affairs may suggest otherwise. In 1858, Watrous wrote a letter to the editor of the Santa Fe Gazette, stating:
 “Shall our favorite grazing grounds be forfeited to the marauding Indians? Shall we
 placidly stand by while they ravage our herds, destroy our grains, murder our people?... 
I have held my peace, but...it is a drop too much and I bear it no longer in
silence.” (Kosmider, 1983, 41).  
The indigenous tribes and the new owners of the land could not coexist, under the strict rulings of governor David Meriwether.  Disagreeing with the previous governor's plan to feed and teach an estimated 500 Jicarillas farming in exchange for them moving towards Abiqui, Meriwether instead halted provisions to these tribes (Kosmider, 193, 30-31).  
 Thus, these tribes were left to fend for themselves, after being promised supplies from the federal government.  Perhaps in retaliation, Ute Chief Chico Velasquez ranchers stole cattle from Watrous’ ranch (Kosmider, 1983, 31). Many historians argue that Indigenous tribes were often raiding the goods and livestock in this area—however, it is important to consider their perspective.  The La Junta area was just as significant to these Indigenous tribes as it was to settlers like Samuel Watrous, and it would be an oversimplification to suggest that these peoples were just marauders or thieves.
