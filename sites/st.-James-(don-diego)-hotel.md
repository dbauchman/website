The St. James hotel established by Henry Lambert was nestled in the base of a mountain, Cimarron, just off the pace of the Santa Fe Trail in the northeast corner of New Mexico. The hotel is a symbol of westward expansion, land grants, ranchers, Native Americans, Spaniards, the European, and traditional New Mexican buildings. Originally established as a restaurant and saloon by Henry Lambert, the building was soon transformed into a not so quaint inn, offering refuge for outlaws, Native Americans, and those travelling to the west. A hotel guest would be welcomed by “Drinking, gambling and guns usually resulting in violence and death,” [^source1]  the hotel, restaurant and saloon truly embodies the nature of the Old Wild West portrayed in cinema and pop culture.

##### WHY CIMARRON, NEW MEXICO
Cimarron, New Mexico, a town rooted in the foothills southeast of the [Sangre De Cristo Mountain Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangre_de_Cristo_Mountains), the town sits just northwest of fertile river valleys. Cimarron was located in the northeast sanction of New Mexico, comfortably seated on the Santa Fe Trail. The landscape surrounding the town, implied almost perfect conditions to settle or a place to stop/make camp including ample water, timber from the mountains, and abundant game and fish [^source]. Cimarron, just southwest of the [Raton Pass](https://www.santafetrailnm.org/site70.html), made for a perfectly nestled sanctuary along the Santa Fe Trail. Cimarron became an advantage along the Santa Fe Trail due to the lesser distance traveled along the [“Cimarron Cutoff,”](https://www.santafetrailnm.org/sfthistory.html) historical links say almost 75% of travelers used this pass even though the “Cutoff” still imposed threats from Native American violence, little to no water, firewood and grass for the animals was apparent on this route [^anothersource]. The town and New Mexico as a whole were slowly being inhabited by those traveling west, the fertile plains and grounded mountains made home to gold mining, Native American strife, passing stage coaches, sheep herders and cattle drivers, all of whom were all too familiar with ringing of a bullets release. Cimarron had such a leisurely attitude at the time, there are not have recollection of building dates, event happenings, or a detailed understanding of the inhabitants from the 19th century. The name stems from big horned sheep, runaway slaves or the flooding of the river.[^thirdsource] More importantly though are the land owners of that region and what they decided to do with their power.

To the north and west rise lofty mountains, and to the sourht and east are two of the most fertile valleys in the state. In addition to the Cimarron River, the water of the Ponil and the Cimarroncito(little wild) Canyons supply adequate water for the town and the irrigation of crops. Near-by mountains provide ample fuel, timner, and game and there is good trout fishing in the surrounding streams.[^source]"

##### THE BEAUBIEN-MIRANDA LAND GRANT & SON-IN-LAW LUCIEN MAXWELL 
In January of 1841 the [Beaubien-Miranda Land Grant](https://newmexicohistory.org/2015/07/21/maxwell-land-grant-an-astounding-piracy-of-the-public-domain/) was petitioned, the grant was a way in which individuals moving west, could establish a homestead,  with additional reasons such as, “to ‘afford protection from the Indians;’ the second: to ‘employ a great number of idlers;’ the third: to ‘relieve overcrowded conditions;’ the fourth: to ‘ease problems caused by a scarcity of irrigation waters,’ and the final reason was ‘to afford safe pasturage for livestock during times of war with the Navajos’”[^fourthsource]. Beaubien, a well off store keeper participating in trade[^fifthsource], and Miranda now together owned roughly 2 million acres of land. The totality of this land soon fell into the hands of [Lucien Bonaparte Maxwell](http://newmexicohistory.org/2015/07/22/lucien-maxwell/); Maxwell was a hunter and trapper originating from Kaskaskia, Illinois, he was in route accompanying [General Fremont](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/john-c-frémont) an expeditioner exploring and surveying for expansion, when Maxwell discovered Cimarron and the Northeast of New Mexico. [^source].  Upon travelling to the southwest, Maxwell decided to create a ranch in 1849, his homestead, by his friend [Kit Carson](https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/carson.htm) whom had arrived in 1826.[^sixthsource] Soon after Maxwell settled into town, he took hand of the daughter of one of the two wealthiest land owners, Beaubien. Her beloved name, Luz Beaubien; Maxwell bought Miranda’s half of the Beaubien-Miranda Land Grant for $2745.00  [^fourthsource] and upon Beaubien’s death in 1865 Maxwell bought the remaining heirs land for $53,000.00 [^fourthsource], becoming the wealthiest land owning individual of his time. “The Maxwell Grant as it was called, included the site of Springer, French, Maxwell, Otero, Raton, Vermejo Park, Ute Park, Elizabethtown, and in Colorado, Vigil, Stonewall, Torres, Cuarto, Tercio, Primero, Segundo”[^source]. Maxwell at this time, had a large fortune, land and had begun a family. Maxwell made the decision to sell his land in 1869 to__________ and then went to retire in Fort Sumner. [^sixthsource] A piece of land in Cimarron, New Mexico had apparently been sold to a man named Henry Lambert in 1871; Maxwell also decided to sell his land to a Grant, when he moved and the grant then governed/sold the land.


##### APRIL 14, 1865: RELEASING HENRY LAMBERT OF HIS DUTY 
Friday, April 14, 1865 the President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and within the transformation of the macro, changes rippled through the micro. Henry Lambert was relinquished of his duty to President Lincoln and General Ulysses S. Grant on that day and with a lament heart he moved southwest for the place he settled, resembled his birthplace most. Lambert was born October 28, 1838 and at the ripe age of 12 was sent to learn how to be a cook at Havre, his journey was seemingly all over the place, working on a French boat which had docked in New York in 1861, working endlessly on ships, submarines, in the navy, in a circus, and for the government/president; Lambert worked anywhere from South America, Maine, New York, to Washington D.C., and Virginia. Lambert attempted roots in Virginia by opening a restaurant, but when hearing of gold moved west in attempts to strike wealth quick.[^seventhsource] Settling originally in [Elizabethtown, NM](https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/ghost-towns/elizabethtown/) which is further burrowed into the mountains and just northwest of Cimarron. Lambert originally drawn by the golden dream, had little luck, so he soon resurrected a restaurant and saloon. [^eigthsource] However at some point in 1871 Lambert was tickled at the opportunity to buy from the Maxwell Land Grant; Lambert then packed his belongings and shifted just southeast to Cimarron to hopefully strike wealth in another fashion. However,
>“There is no deed showing that Lambert purchased the place in 1871. At this time trouble began brewing between the Maxwell Land Grant people and the squatters. Lucien Maxwell may have sold the property to the people concerned. In those days many deeds passed hands by a mere handshake or an old scrap of paper easily lost. With Maxwell selling to the Grant people and moving to Fort Sumner, the settlers had a thoroughly organized syndicate to deal with Holbrook may have not retained proof of his proprietorship, consequently his holdings were turned over to the sheriff for public auction”[^seventhsource].

On May 10, 1875 the piece of land was lawfully then sanctioned as Lamberts for the amount of $102.[^seventhsource] Where originally stood the Lambert Inn, saloon and bar.

##### THE HOTEL & IT’S GUESTS 
The Lambert Inn was remodeled, developing from its former Inn, saloon and bar, and the business renamed as the St. James Hotel unfolded in 1882 [^seventhsource], it was located just off the main street through town, now known as Hwy 21 to Rayado and the Philmont Scout Ranch, the hotel was also positioned just south of the Cimarron River. The hotel was made of traditional stucco…(more information about the appearance of the hotel.) The Inns doors were open to a rainbow of people, shades of justice seekers, justice takers, thieves, Native Americans, and outlaws walked through the doors of the Inn. Offering rest either just before making it to Santa Fe or those travelling in any difference. The Hotel/Inn was famous for quenching the thirst for blood hungry ruffians along the Santa Fe Trail, the hotels walls bore witness to at least 20 murders; Fred Lambert, Henry Lamberts son had apparently recorded 26 killings at the hotel. The phrase, “Lambert had another man for breakfast,”[^source] was common for the towns people to hear. Outlaws, show makers, and those travelling west are still recognized at the hotel today and some of their spirits, such as
>“McMains, Tolby, McCollough, Whigham, Sherwin, Crockett, Dold, Moore, Wheaton, Maxwell, Abreu, Wooton, Kit Carson, Dave Crockett, Clay Allison, Mills, Hixenbaugh, Tom Boggs, Daniel Boons grandson, Rogers, Buffalo Bill, and a host of others whose names are synonymous with American Frontier history”[^seventhsource]. 

As these individuals continued to flood Cimarron, the town continued to grow, the addition of, “15 saloons, 4 hotels, a post office, and a newspaper” [^source] were gradually introduced to the town. 


#### Noteworthy happenings (need to work on this section)
at the hotel include Buffalo Bill Cody meeting his beloved wife and cohost Annie Oakley, and the incident of room 18 where the murder of Thomas James Wright a poker champ claiming the rights to the hotel was staying. Room 18 is still not open to the public to this day. 


##### THE NATURAL SUCCESSION & RENOVATIONS
Henry Lambert died January 24, 1933.[^seventhsource] Fred Lambert, son of Henry Lambert, was Cimarron’s Sherriff; Fred and brother, Gene, began a remodel of the 43 room hotel in 1901, were the discovered in the roof more than 400 bullet holes that could account to the character of this hotel in the scenic wild west. Remodeling the hotel happened few and far between but has seemingly removed much history that remained in its original structure, today however the visitor can still bear witness to the 22 bullet holes in the tin punched ceiling of the dining room. Though ownership of the St. James, or otherwise known as Don Diego, Hotel has changed frequently since the mid 1900’s, but even in April of 1940 according to the Historic American Buildings Survey remarked the hotel as a stopping place along the Santa Fe trail with a famous bar, and that it had been remolded. A place to stay now for over 150 years.

##### THE HOTEL TODAY
Today an individual can stay in a modernized space in the hotel or in one of the hotels historic rooms, with elder furnishings, pictures and fixtures. Nonetheless, a visitor can experience the fixed fashions of the old west through the hung variety of animals heads, old furniture, drab drapes, and the famous dining hall with its original bar. Visitors can remark the dense energy of the building considering its past, but also can find understanding for how life proceeded in its prime, how wild, the west can be and the unique foundation it created for many a traveler.
